First, we need to be able to read our training data, and store it.

We'll need a few classes for this.

Let's make a Java package (call it like filter or something?)

1. Email: type class
    a. Store content in a string
2. DataSet: interface?
3. TrainingData: class that stores our emails (and whether they are spam)
    a. Store emails in ArrayList<Email>
    b. Store type (spam or not spam) in ArrayList<Boolean>
4. MailReader: reads our training data, and makes a TrainingData

That's all i got for now :/
